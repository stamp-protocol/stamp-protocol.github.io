title: "Stamp: a cryptographic identity system"
---

<h1>Stamp protocol</h1>

<p>
Stamp is a distributed, cryptographic identity system.
</p>

<p>
Users make claims about their identity, and others verify and "stamp" these claims to create a
web of trust. Stamp draws inspiration from PGP as a method of determining trust
among peers and Keybase as a way to prove ownership over various decentralized
locations (DNS, HTTP, etc).
</p>

<p>
A Stamp identity consists of three main parts:
</p>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
	{% capture body %}
		<p>
		The keychain is an opinionated collection of cryptographic keys that allow you to
		securely update or publish your identity. This includes setting up a
		recovery policy, making claims, and stamping the claims of others.
		</p>
		<p>
		The keychain also holds subkeys that can be used to send messages to other
		identities or to cryptographically sign messages or files.
		</p>
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/id-part.html title="Keychain" body=body classes="bg-indigo-100" %}

	{% capture body %}
		<p>
		A claim is a verifiable assertion about a personally-identifying piece
		of information. This can be your name, email, a photo, or even things like
		a state-issued ID.
		</p>
		<p>
		Others can stamp your claims, which is how trust flows through the stamp
		network.
		</p>
		<p>
		Each claim can be public for the world to see, or private (encrypted)
		and viewable only by those you give access to.
		</p>
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/id-part.html title="Claims" body=body classes="bg-yellow-100" %}

	{% capture body %}
		<p>
		Forwards allow other systems to use your identity as source of truth.
		</p>
		<p>
		Your followers on a decentralized social network could follow
		<code>stamp://b0ndAF-2sh3Zyodg/forwards/FabNet</code> which would forward
		to your "FabNet" profile, allowing you to update your identity to point to
		a new host without having to rebuild your follower network.
		</p>
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/id-part.html title="Forwards" body=body classes="bg-green-100" %}
</div>

<p>
Stamp Identities are published to StampNet (or, they will be, once it is built),
a p2p network allowing discovery and verification of identities by anybody with
internet access.
</p>

<h2 id="implementations">Implementations - CLI</h2>

<p>
The current implementation of Stamp is built in Rust. It consists of two primary
codebases: <a href="https://github.com/stamp-protocol/core">Stamp core</a> which
provides a functional API for managing identities and the
<a href="https://github.com/stamp-protocol/cli">command-line interface</a>, which
allows interacting with the Stamp protocol from the <span class="text-green-900">welcoming comfort</span>
of your favorite terminal.
</p>

<p>
To get started, turn the computer on. Then <a href="https://github.com/stamp-protocol/cli#getting-started">download and build the CLI</a>.
Good! Now let's start playing with stamp.
</p>
<p>
First, let's create an identity.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp id new</code></pre>

<p>
The program will guide you to creating your first identity, and once you're done,
it will be added to your local identity storage. Your identity will have three
claims: your identity claim, your name claim, and your email claim. You can view
them like so:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp claim list
 ID (short)       | Type     | Value                 | Created      | # stamps 
------------------+----------+-----------------------+--------------+----------
 GCEEQIGwOVBKBrGT | identity | b0ndAF-2sh3Zyodg      | Mar 10, 2021 | 0 
 hElGR6vsTewh7TQv | name     | Zefram Cochrane       | Mar 10, 2021 | 0 
 alwCMEZN_w3XCkyG | email    | zephram@starfleet.org | Mar 10, 2021 | 0 
</code></pre>

<p>
But why settle just for what's given by default? Let's add a claim of our own! 
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp claim new photo /path/to/picture-of-you.jpg</code></pre>

<p>
Well done, your identity has a photo now. People who know what you look like can
now stamp your photo claim, adding trust to your identity!
</p>

<p>
Stamp can also handle another type of claim: one that can be verified immediately.
Both the <code>domain</code> and <code>url</code> claim types support direct
verification. Let's try it out (note that you'll need to be able to write to a
public website to do this).
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp claim new url
Enter the URL you own: https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xXx_Zeph420_xXx                                                                                                                                          
Claim added! You can finalize this claim and make it verifiable instantly to others by updating the URL
https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xXx_Zeph420_xXx to contain one of the following two values:


  stamp:IWbkEc4cCozDnGoJ5Ckz9mSU9EfNQwOvIDF5Gohk8uAXIZ1Lvq2kL06T1uBXCC7135b2AnJj1lsIORVAmN72AAA
  stamp:IWbkEc4cCozDnGoJ
</code></pre>

<p>
So let's update your HackerNews profile at the URL you entered to contain
<code>stamp:IWbkEc4cCozDnGoJ</code>. Now things get spicy:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp claim check IWbkEc4cCozDnGoJ

The claim IWbkEc4cCozDnGoJ has been verified!

It is very likely that the identity b0ndAF-2sh3Zyodg owns the resource
https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xXx_Zeph420_xXx
</code></pre>

<p>
And just like that, you've proved you own your HackerNews profile.
Notice you don't need a central server to check the validity of the claim
(suck it, Keybase). You can do it from the comfort of your 430 sq ft $5,700/mo
San Francisco apartment.
</p>

<p>
Ok, we've set up our claims. Now what? How do we actually, you know, <em>Stamp</em> &copy;
things? Let's <a href="./zephram.stamp">download Zephram's identity</a> (who I may
later refer to as "Zeph"), generated using <code>./stamp id publish</code>. Now
import it into your local storage.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp id import /path/to/zephram.stamp</code></pre>

<p>
Now that it's in our local storage, let's view the claims on this identity.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp claim list --id b0ndAF
 ID (short)       | Type     | Value                                                | Created      | # stamps

<p>
Normally, you'd only stamp a claim if you were actually going to verify it. But
because we're doing a tutorial, let's just pick a claim and <em>pretend</em>
you've verified it, which is exactly how SSL certificate verification works. We're going
to stamp the <code>identity</code> claim.
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp stamp new GCEEQIGwOVBKBrGT
You are about to stamp the claim GCEEQIGwOVBKBrGT made by the identity b0ndAF-2sh3Zyodg.
Effectively, you are vouching for them and that their claim is true. You can specify your confidence in the claim:
    none
        you are not verifying the claim at all, but wish to stamp it anyway
    low
        you have done a quick and dirty verification of the claim
    medium
        you're doing a decent amount of verification, such as having them click a verification link in email
    high
        you have verified the claim extensively (birth certificates, retinal scans, fingerprint matching, etc)
    extreme
        you have known this person for the last 50 years and can be absolutely certain that the claim they are making is correct
        and they are not a hologram or an android imposter

How confident are you in this claim?: low
Would you like your stamp to expire on a certain date? [y/N]: n

Note the lack of fire gifs

surrounding "extreme." This is a bug and we're working on it. Once done, it
spits out our stamp:

<p>
Now you must find a way to communicate this stamp to Zeph. Conveniently, he/they/xe made
an email claim, so you can go ahead and send it to <code>zephram@starfleet.org</code>.
On the receiving end, Zephy might do something like this:
</p>

<pre class="codeblock"><code>$ ./stamp stamp accept --id b0n ./play/stamp 
Stamp d7JpGIOpot5gkbDu accepted!
</code></pre>

<p>
And the stamp is accepted! Zeph thanks you for your trust.
</p>

<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>

<p>
Each identity is a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of modifications created by the
identity's owner which are signed by one of the keys belonging to the identity.
Each transaction, except for the first, references the transaction(s) directly before it.
This creates a chain of modifications that, when applied in order, build a full
identity that can be cryptographically verified.
</p>

<div class="grid md:grid-cols-3 gap-4">
	{% include components/transaction.html prev="[]" txid="0a4b41" body="CreateIdentity" classes="text-red-600" %}
	{% include components/transaction.html prev='[<span class="text-red-600">0a4b41</span>]' txid="f8bb77" body="MakeClaim" classes="text-green-600" %}

</div>

<p>
All private data within an identity (private keys, private claim data) is encrypted
by a master key generated from a passphrase of your choosing. Even if your full Stamp
identity is compromised, it is still protected by your master key.
</p>

<p>
Here's what a published identity looks like (granted, this is a test identity, we still
haven't convinced Zephram to use Stamp yet):

<h3>Keychain</h3>
<p>
There are four main keys an identity uses for either updating or publishing.
</p>

<div class="">
	{% capture body %}
		<p>
		One key to rule them all. It is used to create the identity, and can be
		used to replace any of the other keys that control the identity.
		</p>
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/key.html title="Alpha" body=body classes="bg-indigo-100" %}

	{% capture body %}
		<p>
		The policy key is used to create recovery policies, allowing the identity
		owner to replace compromised keys with newly-generated ones. A valid
		recovery can replace the policy, publish, and root keys.
		</p>
	{% endcapture %}
	{% include components/key.html title="Policy" body=body classes="bg-yellow-100" %}

	<div class="grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-4">
		{% capture body %}
			<p>
			The publish key allows signing and dating all published versions of a
			Stamp identity, useful for proving its overall correctness and preventing
			tampering.
			</p>
		{% endcapture %}
		{% include components/key.html title="Publish" body=body classes="bg-green-100" %}

		{% capture body %}
			<p>
			The root key is effectively the daily-use key of the identity. It is used
			to sign claims, create stamps on the claims of others, manage your subkeys,
			and update any other part of your identity.
			</p>
		{% endcapture %}
		{% include components/key.html title="Root" body=body classes="bg-purple-100" %}
	</div>
</div>

<p>
The keychain also holds "subkeys" which are either revoked/replaced keys from the
list above, or any number of active keys which allow the identity to encrypt or
sign messages or files.
</p>

<h2 id="whyyy">Why??</h2>

<p>
Stamp fills a void in an interesting space: self-owned online identity. Although PGP already
exists as an identity system and trust network, it falls short in a few area. First,
PGP only allows a handful of claims: name, email, and photo. The Stamp protocol allows you to
make any number of claims, from your name, to your age, to your home address, but
also custom claims, such as a state-issued ID number or being a member of an
organization. Each of these claims can be individually stamped, allowing much
more granular trust. For instance, applications might only allow membership if
you have a state-issued ID stamped by a government agency, or you're a bona fide
member of the local trapeze club. Want to write a review
on that oven mitt you bought on Amazon? Better make a DMV appointment! PGP also
falls flat in another area: the keyservers. They allow anybody to create any
number of signatures on your identity without your approval. In Stamp, any changes
to your identity must be <em>approved and signed</em> by you, and a single unified
p2p network replaces a set of federated keyservers that seem to always be broken.
</p>

<p>
Keybase attempted to fix some of the issues with PGP but, bless their hearts, they
decided to do it using a centralized service. Then they had to go and get bought by
Zoom. Oops. Stamp retains much of the functionality of Keybase, such as claiming
ownership of domains and www locations (except for Twitter because Twitter sucks)
but allows verification directly in the client. No need to trust a central third
party.
</p>

<p>
We envision a world where online discourse can be more personal. As it stands,
people must rely on corporations (Facebook, Google, etc) to vet the identities
of their users, but sometimes (read: always) these companies don't have your
best interests in mind. Shouldn't <em>you</em> decide whether the person you're
talking to is Bob from down the street or a Russian troll who wants to convince
you that there are people out there who will stop at nothing to get you to eat
only soy products? Stamp allows you to build your own trust, and does so in a
way that integrates with institutional identity providers. Google or Facebook
or your local DMV can always stamp your identity, and anybody who trusts them
will then have some measure of trust for you! 
</p>

<p>
Beyond online discourse, state-run identity systems are not that great. At
least in the United States, a person's identity comes down to a nine-digit
number that acts as both a username and a password. This is the stupidest
thing in existence, and causes an immense amount of problems. We're not
delusional enough to think that if we build Stamp, states will start using
it <em>just because it's so great</em>, but leaving the next identity
system up to lawmakers (the ones who bring snowballs into congress or
lobby every year to ban encryption) is just as foolish. Perhaps we can
lead by example, and in a perfect world, states might integrate with Stamp
once they realize that, yes, it is great and the SSA is due for a few
updates. But Stamp doesn't care about states: it's a sovereign system! No,
this doesn't mean you can drive without a drivers license, but it does mean
that it exists beyond any state, whether corporate or national, and so your
identity is <em>always yours</em>.
</p>

<p>
As more of the world moves online, it's important that we keep, cherish, and
protect anonymous online interactions and privacy. But it's also important that
we allow building systems that need to rely on trusted identity, such as voting
or non-anonymous communication platforms, in a way that profit-chasing
corporations or antiquated state bureaus don't end up holding the reigns.
</p>

<p>
Join Stamp and take back your online identity!
