<h2 id="whyyy">Why did you build this??</h2>

<p>
Stamp fills a void in an interesting space: self-owned online identity. Although PGP already
exists as an identity system and trust network, it falls short in a few area. First,
PGP only allows a handful of claims: name, email, and photo. The Stamp protocol allows you to
make any number of claims, from your name, to your age, to your home address, but
also custom claims, such as a state-issued ID number or being a member of an
organization. Each of these claims can be individually stamped, allowing much
more granular trust. For instance, applications might only allow membership if
you have a state-issued ID stamped by a government agency. Want to write a review
on that oven mitt you bought on Amazon? Better make a DMV appointment! PGP also
falls flat in another area: the keyservers. They allow anybody to create any
number of signatures on your identity without your approval. In Stamp, any changes
to your identity must be <em>approved and signed</em> by you, and a single unified
p2p network replaces a set of federated keyservers that seem to always be broken.
Lastly, how many times have you <a href="https://alexcabal.com/creating-the-perfect-gpg-keypair">read this guide?</a>
Be honest. PGP is <em>complicated</em> to use.
</p>

Keybase attempted to fix some of the issues with PGP but, bless their hearts, they
decided to do it using a centralized service. Then they had to go and get bought by
Zoom. Oops. Stamp retains much of the functionality of Keybase, such as claiming
ownership of domains and www locations (except for Twitter because Twitter sucks)
but allows verification directly in the client. No need to trust a central third
party.

We envision a world where online discourse can be more personal. As it stands,
people must rely on corporations (Facebook, Google, etc) to vet the identities
of their users, but sometimes (read: always) these companies don't have your
best interests in mind. Shouldn't <em>you</em> decide whether the person you're
talking to is Bob from down the street or a Russian troll who wants to convince
you that there are people out there who will stop at nothing to get you to eat
only soy products? Stamp allows you to build your own trust, and does so in a
way that integrates with institutional identity providers. Google or Facebook
or your local DMV can always stamp your identity, and anybody who trusts them
will then have some measure of trust for you!
</p>

<p>
Beyond online discourse, state-run identity systems are not that great. At
least in the United States, a person's identity comes down to a nine-digit
number that acts as both a username and a password. This is the stupidest
thing in existence, and causes an immense amount of problems. We're not
delusional enough to think that if we build Stamp, states will start using
it <em>just because it's so great</em>, but leaving the next identity
system up to lawmakers (the ones who bring snowballs into congress or
lobby every year to ban encryption) is just as foolish. Perhaps we can
lead by example, and in a perfect world, states might integrate with Stamp
once they realize that, yes, it is great and the SSA is due for a few
updates. But Stamp doesn't care about states: it's a sovereign system! No,
this doesn't mean you can drive without a drivers license, but it does mean
that it exists beyond any state, whether corporate or national, and so your
identity is <em>always yours</em>.

<p>
As more of the world moves online, it's important that we keep, cherish, and
protect anonymous online interactions and privacy. But it's also important that
we allow building systems that need to rely on trusted identity, such as voting
or non-anonymous communication platforms, in a way that profit-chasing
corporations or antiquated state bureaus don't end up holding the reigns.

Join Stamp and take back your online identity!
